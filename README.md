1. Active blind-spot monitoring by using ultrasonic sensors with LED and buzzer feedback. 
2. Car parking sensor using ultrasonic sensors. Buzzer beep frequency is increased if distance between the car and object is decreased. 
3. Buzzer was set up using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM).
4. Ultrasonic sensors detects distance by calculating the time taken between pulse.
